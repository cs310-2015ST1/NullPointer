As an Instagrammer, I want to be able to like a photo and follow the poster when scrolling through results.

Definition of Done:
•	Test that user can login to their Instagram account
•	Test that Instagram gives us permissions to like and follow on poster’s behalf
•	Test that the like and follow icons change according to like/follow status 


As a local Vancouverite, I want to click a café icon on the map and see recently instagrammed photos take 
in that café in order to see menu items.

Definition of Done:
•	Test that map café icon is clickable and a dialog box will appear with name information and the 
  option to view recent instagrammed photos
•	Test the Instagram API gives recently instagrammed photos to a specific location
•	Test that user is able to scroll through photos (at least 10)
