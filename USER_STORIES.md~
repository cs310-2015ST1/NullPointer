1. As a User I'd like to search for places so that I can display the results on a map.
2. As a User I'd like to be able to look at a map of Vancouver so that the locations can be displayed there.
3. As a User I'd like to filter the locations according to my interests (parks, heritage sites,restaurants, etc) so that 
	they are displayed on the map accordingly.
4. As a User I'd like the filtered results to be displayed according to a popularity ranking so that I can choose the one with 
	the highest popularity.
